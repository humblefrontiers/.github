## Welcome to humblefrontiers

Welcome traveler! 👋

The goal of humblefrontiers is to be a hub for maximizing wellness in the world. We aim to do this by taking an interdisciplinary approach, levering engineering, 
social sciences, natural sciences, computer science, philosophy, art and any other source of inspiration for how to model the problem of wellness, including 
new research areas we may need to invent along the way.

## Mission
More formally, the mission of humblefrontiers is to maximize the sum of all known wellness.

## Why this mission?
It's been our lived experiences that living a life that is aligned to wellness can be incredibly hard, even with the best intentions. It seems like at both 
an individual level and societal level, we're not really good at predicting what actions will be aligned to wellness and often make bad assuptions. Perhaps even 
more challenging is that even if we have good ideas of what actions to take to align with our goals, we fail to comply with these stated desires even if we believe 
they align with our best interests.

This misalignment with wellness is currently difficult to measure, but where we do have data does seem to paint a bleak picture. [TODO: Insert stats on wellness trends]

Irrespective of our beliefs that achieving wellness seems difficult, perhaps the best reason for this mission is we honestly couldn't think of a more worthy mission.

## North Star
We believe that the first step to staying accountable to the mission is to have a north star metric to help evaluate the efficacy of our actions. Any metric 
will have shortcomings, but we believe that keeping ourselves accountable to a primary metric which is sufficiently correlated to the abstract idea of maximizing 
wellness will lead to outcomes more aligned with our mission compared to not having a north star metric.

North star: Sum of average weekly wellness as reported by unique humans, on a scale of 0 to 100 where 0 is the worst you could imagine ever feeling and 100 is 
the best you could imagine ever feeling.

## Values
To align with the mission of maximizing wellness, we believe there are some core values worth holding close to us as guardrails.

[TODO: Add values]

We view these values as helpful heuristics for how to drive towards the mission, but these values are only valuable to the extent that they align to the mission.
